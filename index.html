      <h2><span class="emoji">üß†</span> Introduction: It‚Äôs Not Just for "Techies"</h2>
      <p>Coding is becoming a basic skill‚Äîalmost like reading, writing, or doing math. It opens doors in every field, from business to arts. Many students assume coding is only for those pursuing computer science, but that‚Äôs far from the truth. As the world becomes increasingly digital, having a basic understanding of coding empowers students to interact with the digital world more effectively. Coding helps develop critical thinking and opens up new opportunities, even in industries that don‚Äôt primarily deal with technology.</p>

    <!-- Benefits Section -->
    <section id="benefits">
      <h2><span class="emoji">üöÄ</span> Coding Boosts Problem-Solving Skills</h2>
      <p>One of the most valuable skills you‚Äôll develop through coding is problem-solving. Coding trains your brain to think logically and approach challenges methodically. It encourages you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. When you write code, you constantly ask yourself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How can I achieve this step by step?</li>
        <li>What if something goes wrong?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This way of thinking extends beyond programming‚Äîwhether you're solving math problems, organizing a project, or planning an event. The logical thinking and persistence learned from coding are skills that will serve you throughout your life.</p>

    <!-- Empower Section -->
    <section id="empower">
      <h2><span class="emoji">üß∞</span> It Empowers You to Build</h2>
      <p>Imagine an idea pops into your head‚Äîlike a to-do list app, a portfolio website, or a simple game. If you know how to code, you can actually build it. That power of creation is addictive (in a good way). You stop being just a user of technology and become a creator. Instead of simply relying on existing tools, you can customize your experience and solve problems your way.</p>
      <p>I‚Äôve personally built a few projects, like an E-Form web app, and nothing beats the feeling of watching your ideas come to life on the screen. There‚Äôs a sense of accomplishment in transforming an abstract idea into something tangible. Whether it's a simple calculator app or a dynamic website, coding allows you to bring your visions to life in the digital world.</p>

      <h2><span class="emoji">üí∏</span> Career-Boosting Skills in Any Field</h2>
      <p>Coding isn‚Äôt just useful for aspiring software developers. In fact, it‚Äôs a valuable skill for a wide range of professions. Whether you want to be a marketer, scientist, analyst, or entrepreneur‚Äîcoding gives you a competitive edge. It allows you to automate repetitive tasks, analyze complex data sets, and even understand the tech that drives the products you use every day. Some of the key advantages of coding in any career include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automating boring tasks: Say goodbye to manual data entry or organizing files. With a few lines of code, you can automate those repetitive tasks.</li>
        <li>Analyzing data with ease: Code can help you understand trends in large data sets, making it easier to make data-driven decisions.</li>
        <li>Communicating better with tech teams: Understanding the basics of code helps bridge the gap between non-technical and technical teams.</li>
        <li>Understanding how digital products are made: Knowing the basics of coding allows you to better appreciate and critique the tools and applications you use daily.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By learning to code, you‚Äôre not just learning a technical skill‚Äîyou‚Äôre becoming more adaptable in an ever-changing job market.</p>

    <!-- Digital World Section -->
    <section id="digital-world">
      <h2><span class="emoji">üåç</span> Coding is the Language of the Digital World</h2>
      <p>We live in a digital age. From social media algorithms to online shopping to self-driving cars‚Äîeverything runs on code. Understanding even a little bit of how things work behind the scenes gives you a smarter, more informed view of the world. When you learn to code, you gain insights into how technology shapes everything around you. Whether you‚Äôre browsing a website, interacting with an app, or watching a video, understanding the underlying code makes you more aware of the digital world.</p>
